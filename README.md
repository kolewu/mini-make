Make
====

Make is program used to compile large software projects.
It works by reading instructions from a 'Makefile' that describes how to compile the software.
When Make first came out, 'Makefiles' were written by hand.
Now, 'Makefiles' are typically generated by other programs (CMake or Autotools for instance).

This project attempts to implement a Makefile interpreter just enough that it can run a Makefile
generated by CMake.
